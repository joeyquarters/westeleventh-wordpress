# West Eleventh Media

This is the git repository for West Eleventh Media's WordPress website. We switched from using a static site generator (Jekyll) to WordPress for the ability to schedule posts, allow team members without extensive programming experience to update episodes, and provide a better base for building out features.

## File Structure

We use the normal WordPress file structure.

## Dependencies

* Our theme uses [Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) for a better template developing experience.
* We use the [Amazon S3](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) plugin to save costs, lessen server load, and serve assets faster.
* [ACF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) for custom fields
